Thematic topics will expand the scope of the course further, showing how media-based arts have played a role in larger aesthetic themes throughout the modern age and providing a psychological and sociological examination into the effects of new media on the artist and on the viewer. In addition, the coursework is designed to encourage students to explore images and ideas beyond the scope of the material covered in class discussions and the assigned readings. Prepared course materials are supplemented with the student’s own experiences and interests, which can be shared and discussed online in order to promote learning interactions within the group as a whole.

Students completing this course should be able to evaluate both software artifacts and software processes. Software product evaluation includes the evaluation of external characteristics such as usability and functionality, as well as internal characteristics such as design structure, testability and maintainability. Software process evaluation addresses the problem of understanding the software development process, assessing the quality of the process, and developing plans for process improvement. The use of quantitative methods in software engineering will be stressed. The course will also cover experimental methods as they are applied to evaluating software engineering methods.<br />Students will read papers on recent research topics such as regression test selection and prioritization, test input generation, fault localization, automatic program repair, fuzz testing, and metamorphic testing.<br />This semester we will introduce security research topics related to vulnerability assesment, penetration testing, and static analysis of software.<br />For simplicity, we will use Canvas for (1) disseminating slides, papers, and lecture videos, (2) submitting quizzes, discussion posts, assignments, and exams, (3) maintaining a detailed calendar of activities and deadlines, and (4) posting grades. The schedule on the course website will only show the topics being covered every week.</p>","CS-514","Software development process modeling and evaluation; software metrics, testing, verification, validation; experimental methods in software engineering.","6386.0","","0.0","4.0","false","","false"

While collaborating with and assisting Zambians in educational settings (schools, after school programs, adult literacy programs) or in community health arenas (clinics, home-based care, health education programs), students will critically explore how development work is conceptually framed and represented in nonfiction, fiction, and/or memoirs. Students will do this in two ways: first, by exploring a few existing models or examples of writing about development work, and second, by writing a narrative of their own experience as development workers.</p><p>Depending on interest, students will be divided into small groups and partnered with local educational, environmental or public health organizations in Livingstone, Zambia. During the days students will work with their local partner and reconvene in the evenings for group reflection, educational activities and cross-cultural exchange.

The class goes beyond a cursory overview of famous people and dates (found in most introductory mass media courses) to examine how communication has shaped the way people acquire, use and share information. In fact, today’s interactive, electronic media environment has roots in the emergence of books, newspapers and magazines, point-to-point communication, and broadcast media.</p><p>The course takes largely a social history approach, taking into consideration how political, economic, social and technological factors shaped how people communicated in the past and how we interact with others today.</p><p>Students will complete 3 essay exams (90 pts.), 2 short thought papers (20 pts.), and a class project (40 pts.) that allows them to delve into an aspect of media history of particular interest to them. The course is organized into 15 weekly modules that allow students to flexibly accommodate their busy schedules and pace their work. During the summer term, students have the option of completing all requirements in 8 weeks or can take 11 weeks to complete the course on an extended, less frenzied schedule.<br /><br />Topics (subject to change) include:</p><p>Unit 1 - Early Communications</p><ul><li>Media in Today’s Digital Age</li><li>Origins of Communications</li><li>Oral v.

First, we will explore our own areas of individual difference--such as our social class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, immigration status, race, health, generation--and reflect upon how these features influence our perspective on the world and interactions with others within it. Second, drawing upon communication and media theory, we will consider the media's role in shaping our understanding of these areas of individual difference. Third, we will practice strategies for communicating about areas of individual difference and difference of perspective in ways that avoid stereotype and mitigate bias. Finally, based on one's sense of personal and civic responsibility, we will develop a personal code of ethics that can be used to guide professional practice. As an upper division course, some of the skills you make use of in this course are your research, analytical, public speaking, and writing skills. Credit not allowed for both JTC 316 and ETST 316 (Multiculturalism and the Media).</p><p>In a 16-week semester, you should expect to spend about 6-9 hours each week on schoolwork.

But, wise and ethical social media activity is vital for any professional working in today’s digitally-connected economy. This practical class teaches students the skills that they need to use social media strategically to accomplish their goals.<br /><br />JTC 374 is a service-learn course, which means that students are required to volunteer with a local community agency for at least 15 hours over the course of the semester. This volunteer time does not include time spent completing JTC 374 coursework. Rather, the student’s volunteer work should work directly with the community agency to fulfill the community agency’s current volunteer needs.<br /><br />Community agencies are non-profit organizations (i.e., 501(c)3 organizations), government agencies, or community leaders. Examples of community agencies include, but are not limited to, organizations (or, in the case of politicians, political figures) that seek to enhance quality of life within the religious, educational, civic, cultural, economic, or scientific spheres. Prior students have volunteered for local churches, political organizations, honor societies, and homeowners associations. Through this volunteerism, students receive real-world experience applying social media principles and best practices to a specific context. Additionally, students consider how social media can be used for the public good in ethically sound ways.</p>","JTC-374","Organizational uses of interactive media to build relationships and manage online communities.","4430.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Faculty are not required to agree to be on your thesis committee and are limited in the number of projects they can chair.</li><li>Students will submit the GS6 as Plan B unless they have an approved pre-proposal. Following the approval of the pre-proposal, students will be considered Plan A.</li><li>Students will enroll in MU 699 (3 credits) the semester they defend their thesis in order to be graded on the final thesis product and defense.</li><li>Students will work with their thesis advisor on the pre-proposal, thesis proposal, and final draft - submitting to committee with the approval of their advisor. Once the student has sent the full thesis proposal to the committee, there will be no option to change to Plan B; students will be required to complete the project.</li><li>Students who complete a thesis will not need to complete the final common exam.</li><li>Students should maintain realistic expectations for the formation and completion of a thesis.

Even though the issues may change over time, many of the fundamental principles and processes in natural resource policy endure. For aspiring natural resource professionals and anyone interested in the use, management, and conservation of renewable natural resources, understanding and appreciating the historical and political forces that shape natural resource management decisions is vital.<br /><br />Since the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio (1992), international tourism development efforts at local, regional and national levels have focused on tourism as a means to sustainable development. Tourism is seen as an instrument in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), geared towards reducing poverty, fostering sustainable development, and enhancing the resilience of at-risk communities around the world. Increasing destination resilience requires innovation on many levels, and this course analyzes ways in which government, business, and “third sector” organizations may implement sustainable tourism to address an array of international issues and to minimize related vulnerabilities. Instruments for sustainable tourism development are examined and discussed in case studies (international, national, regional and local).<br /><br />This course meets the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requirements for Historical Perspectives (Category 3D).</p>","NR-320","The conservation and sustainable management of land and natural resources in the U.S. is shaped by myriad social, economic, legal, and political forces.

"NSCI 612: Myth Busters–Sci&Controversy","NSCI 612","NSCI 612","1801","","<p>What is science? What isn’t? Modern western science is a product of the Age of Reason in the 18th century, but its origins are traced back to the ancient Greeks. Skepticism and the scientific method are critical to modern scientific practice. Throughout history there has always been an uneasy relationship between science and culture. Science as a human activity is influenced by culture and vice versa. The course weaves science philosophy, methodology, and history with social and cultural contexts. “Culture wars” centered around heliocentrism, evolution, relativity, continental drift, genetically-modified organisms, and climate change are examined.</p><p>A major part of the course is devoted to evaluating claims purporting to use “scientific” evidence. Are there common strategies that people use? The placebo effect and confirmation bias are discussed. The goal is to equip you with practical tools for making science-informed decisions, and not simply accept a claim at face value; in other words, being a skeptic. The course concludes with a section on bioethics and social policy, using The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks as a resource.</p><p>Offered as an online course only.</p>","NSCI-612","Development and practice of western science; understanding how conflicts between science and culture create controversy; and evaluating claims.","16681.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

"PPA 540: International Policy Toolkit","PPA 540","PPA 540","1782","","<p>For any public servant working in the international arena, the difference between efficacy and failure often comes down to deep knowledge of politics and society in foreign countries. Put simply, knowing something about other countries and demonstrating intercultural competence is an essential prerequisite for all international policy practitioners. How do countries shift from one political regime to another? What role does civil society play in mass mobilizations and popular revolutions? What are the sources of ethnic conflict and how can ethnic groups with divergent interests find common ground? Why are some countries besieged by corruption? Who participates in insurgencies and why are some intrastate wars seemingly so intractable? What can or should the international community do about fragile and failed states? Do NGOs help other countries develop and prosper more than they hinder their progress? Under what conditions is democracy promotion advisable and efficacious? Focusing on the cultivation of practical knowledge, this course will provide a valuable toolkit for anyone interested in working for an intergovernmental organization, international non-governmental organization, or for the U.S. foreign policy-making apparatus.</p>","PPA-540","Provides a valuable toolkit for those interested in working for an intergovernmental organization, international non-governmental organization, or for the U.S. foreign policy-making apparatus.

"PPA 544: Ethics and Efficacy","PPA 544","PPA 544","1782","","<p>Making policy across borders poses unique challenges in terms of both ethics and efficacy. By what right do international organizations and governments like the U.S. presume to make policies designed to change the lives of other people? Are there public policies that are suitable to all countries, cultures, and contexts? To what extent are Western governments and international organizations involved in a project of neo-colonialism?

More specifically, students will explore the contributions of major classical theorists, such as Marx, Weber and Durkheim. They will use their sociological imagination to dive more in-depth into core sociological concepts such as critical thinking, structure/agency, social contracts, social classes, power, race/ethnicity, etc. They will also learn to question the epistemological construction of the discipline and how the production of knowledge is also socially constructed. The integrative framework of this course makes a coherent whole to give students a solid knowledge and experience of the development of sociological thought.</p><p>The “Making-of” a discipline:</p><p>What is sociology?

Often, sociology is depicted as the art of using “sociological imagination” to see the world from a critical lens. Sometimes, it is narrowed down to an aggregate of theories, updated as more or less relevant to the “social world” by classical and contemporary authors and often dismissed by students as a very soporific approach to the discipline!</p><p>For others, sociology is the empirical study of social facts, using quantitative or qualitative methodology. Last but not least, some choose sociology as their major because at some point in their student life, the project carried by sociology resonated in their ears and they thought: “Yes, it speaks to me, my reality and the way I see the world and I feel I can learn from it; to be a better professional or just a better person.” These people are in the right spot! “Sociology” truly is about human beings and how they frame social reality through time.<br /><br />Undertaking the journey to understand the development of sociological thoughts is undertaking a journey through time, not as a chronological recall of facts, but to better “feel” the conditions that led such or such author to be concerned with such and such question. Why is Marx remembered as a revolutionary and not for his theory of human nature and creative labor? Why was Durkheim so concerned about social cohesion? Is August Comte really the “founder” of sociology? Why are all these authors mostly White men? These cannot simply be answered by looking at their contributions but through understanding the context in which these authors lived. Yes, sociology can be understood as a juxtaposition of facts, theories and methods, but that would be narrowing down our discipline to an instrumentalist toolbox. Sociology is about understanding our Species Being in inter/action. It was created as a particular framework to see the world from the observation of social historical conditions. But it should be questioned and ceaselessly reinvented to maintain its core ideal around critical thinking and social change! Hence, what I am going to ask from you in this class is to “de-center” yourself. Try to forget what you think you know and board the train to understand these people and their thoughts from a deeper level so YOU can become a better thinker.</p>","SOC-301","Central themes in sociological thought from Enlightenment to present.","9484.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Disasters can be slow to emerge, as is the case with drought, or can be sudden or unexpected such as when earthquakes or tornadoes strike. These events have the potential to disrupt community functioning, cause displacement, and result in significant economic and property loss, injuries, fatalities, and profound emotional suffering.</p><p>Disasters are occurring with greater frequency and greater severity than ever before. Between 1992 and 2012, disasters affected over 4.4 billion people, caused 1.3 million deaths, and resulted in over $2 trillion in economic losses (UNISDR 2012). In part, these global shifts are caused by changing environmental conditions, but they also occur due to entrenched social, economic and political inequalities that expose more and more people to higher levels of risk. This course is designed to introduce students to the sociological investigation of disasters—their origins, effects, and the social dynamics that create risk of and vulnerability to disasters.</p>","SOC-463","Determinants and consequences of behavior and response to environmental extremes including floods, earthquakes, wind, severe storms, and technological emergencies.","9517.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

"SOCR 311: Seed Quality","SOCR 311","SOCR 311","1170","","<p>Whether you are a seed analyst, a seed producer, or a farmer, seed quality is very important to you. This course is valuable to anyone wanting to learn about seed quality, especially for those who are studying to be registered seed technologists or certified seed analysts. Individuals registered or certified by the Society of Commercial Seed Technicians or by the Association of Official Analysts are needed by seed companies and by state and federal seed laboratories.<br /><br />High-quality seed is critical for agriculture to produce enough food to feed the world. Plant breeders work on developing the very best varieties they can and then the seed producers take that seed and carefully grow it to produce the highest seed quality that they can. Plant breeders work with genes that are present in a crop and can even take advantage of genetic engineering and newer techniques such as CRISPR. Seed producers can provide fertile soils, add fertility, and use the best cultural practices available to produce high-quality seed, but some things they cannot control such as the weather. All of these factors combine to determine the quality of the seed that farmers buy. Although grain production is difficult, seed production is even more so because the seed must also be kept alive because vigorous, high-quality seed is a necessity for farmers. Some of the important factors for seed quality include genetic quality, physical purity, germination, and seed health. Higher-quality seed leads to better germination, more vigorous seedling growth, higher crop stands, better quality of produce, and results in higher crop yields. Quality seed requires quality seed production, superior genetics, and proper seed processing.<br /><br />The two main factors that affect seed quality are seed production and genetics. Both are essential to the production of high-quality seed. Seed producers have made tremendous advances in the production of high-quality seed. From planting until harvest, they make sure that the growing conditions are as optimal as possible. Then, the processing of seed insures that only high-quality seed is sold with modern seed treatments also contributing to germination, disease and insect resistance, and protection from adverse weather conditions. All of these contribute to the yield potential of the seed. The most important trait related to seed quality is probably the genetic component. However even with the best genetics, poor seed production will result in poor seed quality. Plant breeders are constantly improving yield potential and stress tolerance with the main goal of plant breeders being to develop higher yielding varieties. However, in the pursuit of this goal, seed quality is also improved because that is also a factor in developing varieties that yield more. To get maximum production of field crops, quality seed is very important.</p><p>If you want to be a seed analyst or work in some way with seeds, learning about how seeds are produced and how genes control traits such as seed quality is important to your job. Learning about these two main factors in seed quality will help you appreciate what has gone into the seed before you have even worked with it. Plant breeding will be thoroughly discussed to show how the genetic makeup of the plant can be modified to improve seed quality.</p><p>Objectives of the course:</p><ul><li>How proper seed production will help to produce quality seed that farmers can plant to produce high yielding crops.</li><li>The importance of genetics to being able to produce high-quality seed.</li><li>How plant breeding works and how genes can be selected that contribute to seed quality.</li><li>The production and breeding of a specific crop.</li><li>Helps seed analysts explain to customers low-quality problems with their seed.</li></ul>","SOCR-311","Importance of seed production and genetics to seed quality.

In this course we explore the tools of environmental economics and then apply these tools to a variety of environmental problems, including oil-spill disasters, acid rain, national parks, water, sustainability, climate change, etc.</p><p>Topics covered:</p><p>• the role of economics in environmental decision making<br />• the basics of markets and market failures<br />• externalities, public goods, and open-access resources<br />• valuing the benefits of environmental protection<br />• valuing the costs of environmental protection<br />• efficiency criteria for evaluating environmental costs<br />• policy tools (controls, taxes, permits) and their assessment<br />• applications to particular pollution issues of interest<br />• economics of renewable resources: fisheries and forests<br />• economics of growth and the environment: development and sustainability</p><p>Throughout the semester the student will:</p><p>• learn the basic concepts and tools of environmental economics;<br />• think critically about current environmental problems using the lens of an environmental economist;<br />• develop the skills to communicate an environmental economic effectively, through writing and oral presentations.</p><p>If you should have any questions about this course offering, please contact Director of <a href=""https://www.online.colostate.edu/degrees/economics/"">Online Studies in Economics</a>, <a href=""mailto:Niroj.Bhattarai@ColoState.edu"">Niroj Bhattarai</a>, for more information. </p>","ECON-240","Discussion and economic analysis of current environmental issues with special emphasis on the impact of economic growth.","42760.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Most often we look at the arts as delivering an experience to an audience. In this course, instead of asking how we bring more audiences to the arts, we ask how can the arts best serve communities? To answer this question, we will explore how to identify and authentically engage with communities, investigate a variety of engagement methods, and explore dynamic community-focused art practices and how to plan them. This course is taught fully online and asynchronous.  </p><p><strong>Section 701</strong><br />Join us this spring for a special ""hybrid"" edition of LEAP 660, <em>Community Engagement and the Arts</em>, a course focused on building and delivering powerful community-focused programs and projects. For this semester, the course will include a community arts-making ""pop-ups"" project in partnership with the City of Fort Collins. Those events will include performance as well as hands-on visual art-making in selected locations around the city. The project will be managed and completed by the students. Through March, non-residential students will attend the scheduled class sessions via zoom. During April (final dates TBD), there will be a two-week window in which the non-residential students will join us in Fort Collins for the live event delivery. </p><p>This course will focus on how to work with community partners in designing, and delivering powerful and transformative arts programming and initiatives. The ""pop-ups"" project will be a real-life experience around how to successfully manage and deliver large-scale arts programming that can shape a community.  As a real-life exploration around partnership development, this course is being offered in collaboration with a number of other university partners.</p><p>Regular attendance during weekly class meetings will be required for content and assignment discussion. There will also be outside requirements as the class manages the development and delivery of this highly visible and dynamic community project. </p>","LEAP-660","Research, development and production of outreach projects; team projects for community engagement.

Proper nutrition for these animals is vital for their physical health and general well-being. This course provides students with an introduction to the amazing animal kingdom, and imparts an awareness of our world's unique animal species and their nutritional needs.</p><p>Zoological institutions--zoos--provide the general public with glimpses of exotic animal species known only from books, stories and the Internet. The animal residents of zoos are in a sense a living museum, and it is our responsibility to provide for their basic needs to the best of our ability.<br /><br />Students taking Zoo Nutrition learn to strategize on how to feed animals by learning animal dietary classifications and gastrointestinal morphology. Based on a few fundamental principles, students develop an awareness of HOW and HOW NOT to feed many new animal species seen in the companion animal trade. Application of these fundamentals saves animal lives and creates a better living environment.</p><p>The course is geared toward zoo professionals; employees of rescue, rehabilitation and animal shelter organizations; and undergraduate students majoring in animal sciences, natural resources, biology, zoology and similar fields. Or if you are someone who is just interested in the course topic (and who has met the necessary prerequisite), you are invited to enroll and enjoy the course.</p>","ANEQ-323","Unique nutritional requirements of mammalian, avian, and reptile captive wild animals; management protocols needed.","5668.0","","2.0","","false","","false"

"ANTH 100: Introduc Cultural Anthropology","ANTH 100","ANTH 100","1787","","<p class=""MsoNormal"">Cultural Anthropology is an exploration of what it means to be a human being. This course examines diverse ways of living across cultures, taking in account differences in origin, language, historical traditions, family organization, economic and political systems, religions, among others. Anthropology takes a holistic approach to such topics as cultural and human survival, the formation of groups and the search for order and meaning, and how and why cultures change. Students will learn about the various methods anthropologists use to study the significance of human difference. Video clips will help students to visualize other cultures and other lives in motion. The readings and assignments seek to create a sense of self-awareness in the context of cultural difference and the relevance of that awareness when dealing with contemporary problems.  </p>","ANTH-100","Human societies and their cultural settings, variation in beliefs, social customs, and technologies; human differences in anthropological terms.","6142.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Articulate primary methods of expression.</p><p><br />Letter From Instructor</p><p>Hello! My name is Monica Deming and I will be your instructor for ART 100 – Introduction to Art. I have been teaching at Colorado State University for more than twenty years and have taught all kinds of different classes within the Department of Art and Art History. I began here years ago teaching drawing classes of all levels, then I moved on to teach painting and now Foundations. I am a working artist with an MFA in studio art from here at CSU (Go Rams!) and a BFA in communication design from the University of Nebraska–Kearney. I love teaching this class because I get to work with students from all over the University system who have a variety of interests and backgrounds.</p><p>In this class you will not only be studying the history of visual thinking from around the world, but you will get a chance to become an active participant in the art world as well. You will have an opportunity to go out searching in the world around you for things that are influenced by the visual ideas we are studying. You will get to see how museum curators put together exhibits, go on a virtual museum tour, and even compile your own digital show of images from history.<br /><br />My hope is that when you complete this course that you will have not only a working knowledge of basic art history but also a little insight into how artists see the world as well. I hope you enjoy the course and please – if you have questions or concerns don’t hesitate to contact me at any time.<br /><br />Monica Deming<br />Senior Teaching <a href=""mailto:mdeming@colostate.edu"">mdeming@colostate.edu</a><br />The Department of Art and Art History<br />Office – F104 Visual Arts</p>","ART-100","Exploration of the development of the visual arts based on formal, critical and contextual analysis of specific works of art and their creators.

Particularly, we will begin by exploring the influence the Near East had upon Western Society. Then the early political and cultural systems of the Ancient Greeks and Romans will be examined to understand their impact on society today. The Middle Ages will be assessed to reveal the developments in thought, religion, society and technology throughout Europe’s early stages.

To this end, we will survey topics in Western society, culture, environment, and politics from the Protestant Reformation to recent events. We will pay attention to large, comparative themes. If you are interested in the environment, philosophy, in comparative religions, in women and gender history, in science, politics, art, empires and great battles of the past then this course if for you. If you are not sure, but think you might be interested in some of these things, this is especially the course for you! The course will focus on Europe but we will also consider Europe’s relationships with other parts of the world.<br /><br /> The course will be divided into three parts, punctuated by examinations. The first part will begin roughly with the Renaissance during the fifteenth century and carry forward to the “Age of Enlightenment,” while noting the impact of the Little Ice Age. The second part will begin with the French Revolution and industrialization, and will proceed to the eve of the First World War. The final part will examine the Russian Revolution, the rise of fascism and Stalinism, two world wars, and postwar themes such as the onset of global warming, decolonization, European unification, youth culture, the end of Communism, and the “new immigration.”</p>","HIST-101","Historical development of Western civilization from c. 1600 C.E. to the contemporary era.","10114.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Or, are you still trying to find your vocational calling—that place that Frederick Buechner described as “the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet?”<br /><br />Regardless of your career path, you will need solid communication to achieve your career goals. Strong communication skills help you do more than achieve your ambitions, though. They help you become a more agile professional. Writing, speaking, and listening skills are valued across departments, companies, and even industries. When you are armed with strong communication skills, you will find it easier to adapt to the times—whatever those times look like.<br /><br />In this course, you’ll have the opportunity to improve your writing skills. You will create several writing projects (including a memo, proposal, brochure, outline, annotated bibliography, and white paper) and receive ample feedback on these projects from your peers and instructor. We will consider how areas of individual difference—like our generation and culture—influence how we write and expect others to write. We’ll even consider how a government law—the Plain Writing Act of 2010—has changed workplace communication today. Ultimately, by the end of the course, you will be more equipped to present yourself and your (current or future) company in ways that will help you achieve your goals.</p><p>This course meets the All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC) requirements for Advanced Writing (Category 2) and is approved under gtPathways in the content area of Advanced Writing (GT-CO3).<br />Upon the completion of this course, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Apply and reflect upon contemporary texts and (communication and new media) theories and their implications for competent corporate and professional communication (fulfills CO-3 Objective 1).</li><li>Explain and practice strategies to make their writing more concise, ethical, and straightforward across all stages of the writing process, including generating ideas, identifying sources, evaluating sources, drafting, citing, revising, editing (for the self and others), and presenting (fulfills CO-3 Objectives 2 and 4).</li><li>Recognize audience members’ areas of individual difference and modify writing practices based on these differences (fulfills CO-3 Objective 3).</li><li>Create common business documents and presentations that adhere to established business writing and communication norms, including the norms for formatting and content (fulfills CO-3 Objective 5).</li><li>Demonstrate basic competence in common new media technologies used in business communication contexts (fulfills CO-3 Objective 5).</li></ul><p> </p>","JTC-301","Corporate and Professional Communication","7848.0","","0.0","3.0","false","","false"

Video editing is the process of storytelling by combining video, audio, and graphic elements into a coherent whole. The best editing is invisible; when it is done well, it is hardly noticed. Editing is about storytelling. While the class does train you to use Adobe Premiere Pro, you will be able to use the skills learned in this class on any professional editing software. We provide all of the raw footage for your editing assignments, but you have the choice to shoot your own footage towards the end.</p><p>By the end of this course, you will learn:</p><p>o How to make awesome videos including: promos, mini documentaries, news stories, PR pieces, short films, music videos, and more<br />o The importance of planning before sitting down at a computer<br />o The importance of storytelling in editing - Editing is storytelling<br />o How to tell a compelling visual story using a combination of video, text, soundbites &amp; music.<br />o Basic principles of picture composition<br />o The importance of aesthetics<br />o The importance of ethical editing</p><p><strong>Textbooks and Materials</strong><br />•All students are given access to Linked-In Learning content that is required for the course. This is paid for by your student fees, so do not pay for Linked-In Learning.<br />• Adobe Premiere Pro Access: This is the editing software for this course and you need to purchase this for your computer or at least have access to a computer with it on. You may just want to get the whole creative suite if you are very interested in video editing - all the software work really nicely together and Photoshop, Audition, and Encoder come in handy. Make sure your computer is powerful enough to handle the software! Read the minimum specs so it doesn't crash your computer and make you sad. The <u>whole suite</u> is actually slightly cheaper than just Premiere for students, however you have to commit for a year.<br />o Recommended - Entire suite including Premiere: $19.99 per month for students, annual commitment<br />o Premiere Pro Only - $31.49 per month, no commitment<br />o Premiere Pro Only - $20.99 per month, annual commitment (Don't do this option! Just get the whole suite if you plan to commit for a year anyway)<br />• Hard drive: If you are using a personal computer, you technically don’t need this if you have sufficient built in storage, but I still highly recommend it. If you are using a computer on campus, you need it. Even on your personal computer, you will likely slow down your computer with all the files.

Overall, I think the teaching style of this class was great, It was a nice pace, and the instructor gave plenty of great feedback a long the way.

These factors also are changing the types of communication skills employees must master.</p><p>This course is designed to be accessible to students from a wide variety of educational backgrounds. It provides students with an understanding of the factors that make contemporary communication competence so difficult to master. Students will study how communication theories provide today's employees with valuable tools for improving their own and their (current or future) company's communication competence with key audiences. Additionally, as students progress through this course, they will receive substantial feedback not only on their ideas but also on their writing quality.

Students will learn to identify arguments and their key components such as premises and conclusions; they will understand what makes arguments good ones and see multiple examples of logical fallacies. They will learn formal and informal techniques for analyzing arguments and will see psychological barriers to logical reasoning. Discussions posts, quizzes, homework, exams and a class paper give students ample opportunities to practice course concepts. They will leave with an appreciation of why “The unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>","PHIL-110","Identify, analyze, and evaluate real arguments in everyday life, politics, the sciences, and the professions.","9159.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

"POLS 103: State&Local Governmnt&Politics","POLS 103","POLS 103","1782","","<p>Welcome to State and Local Government and Politics!<br /><br />State and local governments are vital components of the American political system. While the activities of national-level actors, such as the president and Congress, tend to be most visible to the average citizen (especially through the news media), actors at the state and local level frequently make political decisions that impact our daily lives. In addition, states and localities often experiment with innovative policies in an attempt to address social, economic, and environmental problems. Given the importance of states and localities in American politics, this course is designed to provide you with an understanding of the structure, functions, and responsibilities of state and local governments. We will explore the impacts of decisions made at the state and local level, compare and contrast policies across various states and localities, and learn about how these levels of government function and interact with each other. We will also apply our knowledge of state and local politics to current issues, such as economic development, criminal justice, and budgeting.<br /><br />Through readings, lectures, group discussions, and assignments, you will be able to achieve four primary learning outcomes during this course. First, you will gain a broader and deeper understanding of how state and local governments work and what their responsibilities are and, secondly, will understand the unique challenges that state and local governments face. Third, we will analyze the role of state and local actors in solving pressing contemporary problems, such as economic issues and environmental concerns. Lastly, we will discuss how the actions of state and local governments impact our daily lives.</p>","POLS-103","Principles, organization, and operation of American state and local government.","9234.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

"POLS 364: U.S. Energy Policy Analysis","POLS 364","POLS 364","1782","","<p>This course is about Energy Policy Analysis, a kind of applied public policy analysis. For those of you who haven’t used the term, public policy is many things to many people. We'll explore that in class. Where does one find public policy? Mostly in official decisions of government: Laws, rules; Judicial court decisions, orders; Executive orders, speeches, rules, regulations. Those are the principle places to find the official decisions of government, to find out what our public policy is at a particular time.<br /><br />A conceptual framework will be presented for analysis of energy technologies and alternative national energy policy choices in terms of their dollar, environmental, and national security costs. Issues and problems associated with implementation of U.S. energy policies will be examined in the context of major social goals (e.g., growth, equity), with treatment of conflicts and trade-offs between energy development and other social values (e.g., health and safety, cultural and aesthetic values).<br /><br />Modules require students watch short videos about energy topics with which they may be unfamiliar, and some short readings other than the required text.</p><ul><ul><li>Module 1: Introduction: Where did oxygen come from, and what does it take to make ice burst into flames?</li><li>Module 2: Supply Expansion and Demand Suppression</li></ul></ul><br /><p>Historically, there have been three general approaches to energy policy analysis in the U.S. Here are two of them: supply expansion and demand suppression. The third one is below.</p><ul><li>Module 3: Cost Analysis: Analytical Framework</li><li>Module 4: Are We Ready for 250 Million Climate Change Refugees?</li><li>Module 5: Environmental Costs of Coal, Nuclear, Oil and Gas</li><li>Module 6: Environmental Costs of Solar, Wind and Geothermal</li><li>Module 7: Environmental Costs of All the Rest (Hydroelectricity, Biomass, Conservation and Efficiency, Ocean, Hydrogen, Transportation and Electricity Transmission)</li><li>Module 8: Dollar Costs of Energy Fuel Technologies</li><li>Module 9: National Security Costs of Energy Technologies</li><li>Module 10: Observations about Costs of Technologies</li><li>Module 11: Revolutionary Energy Technologies in the Near-Term</li><li>Module 12: Energy Technologies Going Nowhere: Fusion</li><li>Module 13: Hoax Energy Technologies: Cold Fusion</li><li>Module 14: Transportation and Electricity Transmission</li><li>Module 15: Elements of a National Energy Policy</li><li>Module 16: The Gaia Theory</li></ul><p>Course Requirements: This class will be conducted as an advanced undergraduate seminar. The entire course will be structured around development of a policy analysis within a single substantive policy area: energy policy. This is learning by doing.</p><p>Quizzes: There will be a quiz each week for a total of 15 quizzes, but only scores on the best 10 of them will count towards your final grade. The others will be dropped into a black hole. Everybody has bad days, and the goal here is to see the best you can do. You will need to complete the quiz for each week before you can move on to the next week, but you may move along at your own pace.<br /><br />Book Review: A book review of no more than 4-5 typewritten pages is due November 26, for 400 points. The book must be relevant to evaluation of at least one of the energy fuel technologies we are investigating. See reading on Writing a Book Review for guidance. Hint: avoid collections of articles by several authors; they are more difficult to review.<br /><br />Discussion: Discussion of ideas in the course is required and will be graded. Students will need to make at least one original posting of at least 100 words, and three replies of at least 50 words to postings by others on each discussion question. Most discussion questions ask for your opinion about something. Your opinion will not be graded. Grading will be based on how you use information in the course to support your opinions.<br /><br />I expect this course will be a voyage of discovery for most students, no matter how much you know about this subject.</p>","POLS-364","Discussion and analysis of energy use and its impact on the economy and environment with an emphasis on future policy.","3931.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

In this course, you are going to learn the fundamentals of data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that aims to produce insight from data. The focus will be on using data science for social good – that is, to help illuminate, understand, and solve the problems in our society that are related to health inequity and social injustice. You will learn how to do all of this work using RStudio — including data visualization, data carpentry, data modeling, and reporting of all your produced work using beautiful R Markdown Reports.

Out of what historical, commercial, and creative contexts does popular culture emerge? These broad questions fuel our work in this course. Communication and Popular Culture presents an introduction to U.S. popular culture, with an emphasis on its forms and functions in our society. First, we engage four key domains that construct popular culture’s meanings in order to empower students with the critical skills to understand cultural texts. Second, we consider how popular culture has both shaped and reflected broader social power dynamics in the United States. Finally, we analyze popular culture in detailed written arguments and cogent oral presentations. Because this is an All-University Core Curriculum course, we have specific objectives: to place the history of popular culture within a broader context of U.S. history; to analyze a variety of texts that loosely fall into the category “arts and humanities,” and to suggest particular methods of critical thinking.<br /><br />Course Objectives</p><ul><li>Describe popular culture texts from a Communication Studies perspective and define and utilize key media analysis terms.</li><li>Explain the relationship between popular culture texts and their socio-historical contexts.</li><li>Analyze the industries that produce popular culture texts.</li><li>Analyze popular culture texts’ power to represent and shape social power and cultural identities.</li><li>Critique and construct arguments about popular culture and/as communication through research, writing, and cultural engagement.</li></ul>","SPCM-100","Classical tradition of speech communication, its extension to broadcasting, and integration of both in contemporary culture.","9366.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

Therefore, Colorado State University’s Department of Communication Studies requires the following for each speech in SPCM 200 Online:</p><ul><li>A student must deliver each speech in front of a live audience consisting of at least 6 adults (16 years or older).</li><li>These adults must be seen on camera.</li><li>Ask one of your audience members to be the camera person for your speech.</li><li>When the camera starts to record, have the camera person pan around the room showing the live audience, then when the camera points back to you, you may start delivering your speech.</li><li>Have the camera person sit with other members of the audience. While you are speaking talk to your audience members as well as the camera, but do not solely stare at the camera. Make sure you are making good eye contact and facial expressions with your live audience in addition to the camera.</li></ul><p>Suggestions for finding a live audience: Many students ask their friends and family to be their live audience for this course, which is acceptable provided audience members meet age criteria. Communities also have a local organization called Toastmasters you can join whose purpose is to practice public speaking skills; you might look for a local chapter and join for the semester. You may also ask classmates from other courses, coworkers, or members of your church or other community organization(s) you may belong to.</p><p>Audiences may vary from speech to speech or may remain consistent. You are welcome to contact your classmates in this course and gather together to be an audience for each other at a time and location that might work for all of you.

Some have argued that democracy is at risk in the United States. Critics point the finger at a host of culprits: apathetic, disenchanted, or uninformed voters; greedy special interests and inadequate campaign finance laws; corrupt politicians; jaded media corporations who cover politics with an eye toward their business interests. It is impossible to fully assess the political state of our Union (or dis-Union) without considering politics from a rhetorical perspective. Through communication, candidates reveal their character and political agendas. Voters form opinions about politics by watching television, reading newspapers and magazines, going online, and talking with friends and family members. News organizations filter and frame the political information citizens receive. Many Americans form political opinions after viewing communication in alternative contexts such as late-night talk shows and comedy programs.<br /><br />The purpose of this course is to promote engaged citizenship by exposing ourselves to the rhetoric of political campaigns and practicing the skills required to sustain democracy: participation, open-minded consideration, critical reflection, and the formation and justification of political judgment. We will examine the rhetoric of political campaigns, critically assessing the communication produced by candidates and campaigns (speeches, appearances, ads, Web pages, and debates), as well as the rhetorical nature of political journalism. The course focuses on contemporary and historical U.S. national political discourse; however, local information and examples will also be addressed.</p>","SPCM-420","Rhetoric of political campaigns.","9765.0","","3.0","","false","","false"

"a05VA000008KElS","JTC 220","","UNKNWN","","<p>This course is all about learning to discern truthful reporting from propaganda. Manipulating the news to achieve one’s political agenda is nothing new. Consider that in the 17th century candidates for public office commonly accused each other in the press of heinous sexual behavior and having fathered illegitimate children. As journalism became more sophisticated and responsible in the 20th century, mainstream news media outlets embraced the notion of objectivity. Stories were vetted for accuracy and balance. But amid the rise of the digital age, virtually anyone today with an agenda and access to the internet can call themselves a journalist without regard to the traditions of truth and fairness. Many of the stories we read or see these days that pass themselves off as journalism are little more than rumors, fabrications and flat-out lies.<br /><br />Taught by CSU journalism graduate and former Pulitzer Prize-winning news reporter David Freed, JTC 220 will help you become a more discerning consumer of news. Armed with critical-thinking skills, a firm grasp of relevant history and a practical knowledge about the news media, you will learn how to find reliable information and disseminate it responsibly, both as members of the media and as citizens.<br />You will be expected to be passionately interested in the news, prepared to discuss in detail current events. Professional journalists are by nature curious about the world around them. They question, probe, and objectively consider other points of view as they strive for the truth. Students in this class will be expected to do the same.</p><p>By the end of this class, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>demonstrate critical thinking in analyzing each day’s news.</li><li>judge the reliability of news reports by having weighed evidence and evaluating sources.</li><li>know how to differentiate between real journalism, opinion and unsupported assertion.</li><li>recognize the difference between news media bias and audience bias.</li><li>write effectively about journalism standards and practices, fairness and bias, First Amendment issues and the individual rights and responsibilities of reporters.</li></ul>","JTC-220","Distinguish truthful reporting from propaganda to become more discerning news consumers.","","","","","false","","false"
